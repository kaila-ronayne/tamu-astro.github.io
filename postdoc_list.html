										<h1>Astronomy Postdocs &amp; Researchers</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Our amazing postdocs and researchers contribute significantly to the fantastic science done in our astronomy group. Additionally, some of our graduate students work directly with them, with a faculty member acting as an additional advisor (and official chair of their committee).</br></p>

                                    <p><strong>If you have any questions,</strong> feel free to reach out to our current postdoc contact, Jasleen Matharu (<a href='mailto:jmatharu@tamu.edu' target="_blank">jmatharu@tamu.edu</a>).</p>

												<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile_stephanie.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
												<p>Stephanie Ho is an astronomy postdoc working with Rob Kennicutt. Stephanie studies the diffuse gas around galaxies known as the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and is interested in understanding how the CGM affects the evolution of galaxies. Outside of astronomy, Stephanie enjoys playing Go and the violin. To learn more about Stephanie, check out the website: <a href="https://www.stephaniehho.com" target="_blank">stephanieho.com</a></p>

                                                <p>Jasleen Matharu's research broadly lies in the area of galaxy evolution. She is interested in understanding the assembly and growth of galaxies, and how this is affected by the large-scale environment within which galaxies reside. To help answer these research questions, Dr. Matharu uses observations of distant galaxies made with the Hubble Space Telescope. In particular, her work uses the unique capabilities of space-based slitless spectroscopy, which can spatially map where star formation occurs in individual galaxies. Prior to beginning her postdoctoral research at Texas A&amp;M University, Jasleen Matharu was a graduate student at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge and an undergraduate student at University College London (UCL).
