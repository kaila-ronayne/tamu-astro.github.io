document.write("<p>White supremacy pervades our society, systematically and intentionally oppressing Black people. The United States of America is crafted to burden Black people with poverty and neglect their health. Furthermore, it sustains legal slavery via an unjust prison system that disproportionately incarcerates Black people. Additionally, police officers regularly use excessive force and often murder Black people with no legal consequences.</p>");

document.write("<p>We demand justice for Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Daniel Prude, Nina Pop, Rayshard Brooks, David McAtee, Dijon Kizzee, Casey Goodson, and all those who suffer and have suffered at the hands of police brutality and systemic racism. Black lives matter.</br></br></p>");
