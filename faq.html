                                    <p><h2><strong>Application questions</strong></h2></p>
                                    <p><h3>1. First things first: How to apply!</h3></p>
                                    <p>Check out <a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/grad/prospective-students">this</a> page on the official TAMU Physics and Astronomy website to see how to apply. Please do not hesitate to reach out to the astronomy department for a fee exemption on your application at skessler@tamu.edu.
                                    
                                    <p><h3>2. Do you require the GRE/PGRE?</h3></p>
                                    <p>Neither the General GRE nor the GRE subject test in Physics are required for Astronomy PhD applicants. Neither test score is considered when comparing applications.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h3>3. Can my application fee be waived?</h3></p>
                                    <p>If the application fee presents a financial hardship, U.S. citizens or permanent residents may be eligible for a fee waiver as outlined on the <href="http://admissions.tamu.edu/graduate/apply">Texas A&amp;M Graduate Admissions website</a>. International applicants and other applicants who are not eligible for this fee waiver, and for whom the application fee presents a financial hardship, should contact the department at admissions@physics.tamu.edu to request assistance.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h3>4. Will I be paid to be a graduate student?</h3></p>
                                    <p>Yes! Graduate students in good standing can expect to receive financial support for the duration of their studies. In general, the astronomy group does not admit more students than they can afford. This support includes full tuition and fee coverage each semester, a stipend ($2100/month, before taxes), and health insurance.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h3>5. How are graduate students paid?</h3></p>
                                    <p>Most graduate students are employed as Teaching Assistants (TAs) for their first 2-3 years. Usually, graduate students are paid as Research Assistants (RAs) over the summer. Whether you get paid as an RA in the Spring/Fall semesters often depends on your advisor’s funding situation and how many TA positions need to be filled vs how many TAs are available. If you are awarded a grant or fellowship, that may be your primary source of funding.</p>
                                    <p>It's common for students interested in leaving academia after their MS or PhD to apply for paid internships outside Texas A&amp;M, usually over the summer. Sometimes, students apply for opportunities with other universities or research institutions.</a>
                                    <p>For the Spring 2021 semester, the astronomy group consisted of 19 graduate students. Of those, 3 students were funded as full-time Research Assistants (RAs), 3 students were funded for full-time research by fellowships, 1 student was funded half-time by a fellowship and as a half-time RA, 9 students were funded as half-time TAs and half-time RAs, and 4 students were funded as full-time TAs. The astronomy group regularly nominates incoming students for University fellowships, including the Graduate Diversity Excellence Fellowship. The astronomy group also encourages students to apply for fellowships outside Texas A&amp;M. 2 current astronomy graduate students have been awarded the NSF GRFP.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><h3>6. What was that about health insurance?</h3></p>
                                    <p>You can get health insurance, paid for by the university. In addition to your own coverage, you can add dependants onto your insurance, if needed (in this case, ~$50/month to cover 1 dependant is subtracted from your paycheck). You can also opt-in to vision ($7.60/month), dental ($29.42/month), and life insurance, among other benefits (the cost of any additional benefits you opt-in for will come out of your paycheck).

									<p><h2><strong>Life in Bryan/College Station</strong></h2></p>
									<p> <h3> 1. Housing? Housing! </h3></p>
									<p>The Mitchell Building for Fundamental Astronomy and Physics (where all of the astronomy faculty and grad students have offices) is at the very northern edge of campus. If you’re arriving in B/CS without a car, it’s a good idea to select an apartment in the Northgate area, which is just a ten minute walk from our building.
                                    The cheapest you can find for a one bedroom apartment is around $600/month (such as <a href="https://www.centuryoakbcs.com/">this apartment complex</a>). A handful of the astronomy graduate students live in The Northgate Lofts for $725/month as well.</p>
 
                                    <p>There are also a number of large scale apartment complexes just across the street from our building, such as Cherry Street Apartments and The Tradition, some of which include amenities such as a gym and pool. However, graduate students usually do not choose to live there, because they are predominantly occupied by undergraduates and are more expensive than the smaller apartments a few blocks north (~$1000/month dollars for one bedroom).</p>

                                    <p>If you’re arriving to B/CS with a vehicle, quite a few of the graduate students live in apartments in the Wolf Pen Creek area. Typical rent costs around $800/month for a one bedroom ($900-$1000/month for two bedrooms).</p>
                                    <p> <h3> 2. Where do people usually go to do their grocery shopping? </h3></p>
                                    <p>For those close to campus without a car, the nearest store is a CVS across the street from the Mitchell building. You can purchase toiletries, snacks, medicine, frozen foods, etc. For fresh food, there is the Farm Patch Produce Market on College Avenue, which is just a 10 minute bike ride from Northgate. There are also two H-E-B grocery stores (one on Villa Maria Rd, another on Texas Ave) that are also a 10 minute bike ride away.</p>

                                    <p>For those with a car, there are 5 H-E-Bs (all hail our grocer overlord), 3 Wal-Marts, 2 Targets, and 2 Krogers. To avoid larger undergraduate crowds, we suggest doing your grocery shopping on football gamedays during the game.

									<h2><strong>Department Culture</strong></h2>
                                    <h3> 1. What has been your favorite departmental events/activities so far?</h3>

                                    <h3>3. What are things that grad students here do daily/weekly/monthly together?</h3>
                                    <p>When working in the office, the graduate students often eat lunch together, and get coffee or go on walks to take breaks during the day. Every Friday, a large group of astronomers and physicists walk from the office building to a bar in Northgate around 5pm (or meet up via gather.town during the pandemic) to hang out.</p>
                                    <p>Outside of work, some graduate students host semi-regular table-top gaming or movie-watching nights (held over zoom during the pandemic). Bryan also has a music scene, especially for punk and metal, as displayed at the annual <a href="http://www.bcsloudfest.com/">LoudFest</a>, which several graduate students usually attend.</p>

									<p><h3>2. How much time do you spend weekly being a TA? Is it manageable along with classes and research?</h3></p>
