                                    <h2><strong>Master's/</strong>Coursework</h2>
                                    <p>Students enrolled in the Astronomy PhD program typically pick up their Master's on their way to the PhD. The Master's degree requires a total of 36 hours of coursework (including classes and research). Students typically enroll in 9 hours per semester.</p>
                                    <p>Students take 2 classes per semester for their first 2 years, in addition to participating in journal club (ASTR 681: Seminar) and our Order of Magnitude class each semester for those 2 years (see the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for more information about journal club and Order of Magnitude). In addition to the 6 required Astronomy classes, students take 2 elective courses, usually either physics courses (for the Astrophysics track) or statistics courses (for the Astrostatistics track).
                                    <p>The required Astronomy classes are listed below:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>ASTR 601: Extragalactic Astronomy</li>
                                        <li>ASTR 602: Astronomical Observing Techniques and Instrumentation</li>
                                        <li>ASTR 603: Stellar Astrophysics</li>
                                        <li>ASTR 604: Cosmology</li>
                                        <li>ASTR 605: Galactic Astronomy</li>
                                        <li>ASTR 606: Radiative Transfer</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Students enrolled in the Astrophysics track take PHYS 615: Methods of Theoretical Physics I, in addition to one of the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>PHYS 601: Classical Mechanics</li>
                                        <li>PHYS 603: Electromagnetic Theory I</li>
                                        <li>PHYS 606: Quantum Mechanics</li>
                                        <li>PHYS 607: Statistical Mechanics</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                    <p>Students in the Astrostatistics track take STAT 630: Overview of Mathematical Statistics and one of the following:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>STAT 624: Databases and Computational Tools Used in Big Data</li>
                                        <li>STAT 636: Applied Multivariate Analysis and Statistical Learning</li>
                                        <li>STAT 638: Introduction to Applied Bayesian Methods</li>
                                        <li>STAT 639: Data Mining and Analysis</li>
                                        <li>STAT 654: Statistical Computing with R and Python</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <h3><strong>Research/</strong>Master's Defense</h3>
                                    <p>Each semester, you will enroll in 9 total credit hours. After you enroll in your classes for the semester, however many hours you have left out of those 9 will be filled with research credits (ASTR 685: Directed Studies). Additionally, each summer, you will enroll in 6 hours of research. Research is strongly encouraged to be your primary focus in graduate school, even while you are taking classes.</p>
                                    <p>To complete your Master's degree, you will give a ~45 minute presentation of your research, followed by a closed-door questioning session with your committee. Some students may complete their PhD candidacy exam simultaneously with their Master's defense. Most students acquire their Master's degree between their 2nd and 4th years of graduate school.</p>

									<h2><strong>PhD candidacy</strong>/defense</h2>
                                    <p>Once you have completed your Master's degree, you will enroll in 9 hours of research (ASTR 691: Directed Studies) each semester, and 6 hours of research over the summer, until you graduate. If you do not get a Master's degree, you must complete a total of 96 hours (including coursework and research) to complete your PhD. If you get a Master's degree along the way, you must complete a total of 64 hours of work <i>after</i> your Master's (typically consisting solely of research hours).</p>
                                    <p>Students who do not complete their PhD candidacy exam simultaneously with their Master's defense must do so separately. In this cast, the PhD candidacy exam consists of a ~30-45 minute presentation of your research, with a focus on what you plan to do for the your PhD, followed by a closed-door questioning session with your committee.</p>
                                    <p>To complete your PhD, you will again give a ~45 minute presentation of your research, followed by a closed-door questioning session with your committee. You must also complete a writen dissertation, the chapters of which are typically composed of your papers/publications. In the Astronomy PhD program, the majority of students take 6 years to graduate, although some take 5 years.</p>
