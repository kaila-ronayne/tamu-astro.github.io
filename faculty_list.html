												<h3>Rob Kennicut</h3>
                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile_rob.jpg" alt="" /></span>Rob Kennicutt's research focuses on galaxy formation and evolution. He has studied relationships between star formation rate and other physical properties in galaxies. He extended the Schmidt Law &mdash; relating star formation rate to the local gas surface density &mdash; to observations of H&alpha; and constrained the law on nearby galaxies. He is also currently faculty at the <a href="https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/rob-kennicutt">University of Arizona</a>. He has previously served as Director of the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge and Editor-in-Chief of The Astrophysical Journal. Recently, he was co-chair of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey.</p>

												<h3>Casey Papovich</h3>
												<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile_casey.jpg" alt="" /></span>Casey Papovich researches observational cosmology, galaxy evolution and formation, testing feedback in galaxy evolution, and large-scale galaxy structure. Some of his work has focused on studing high-redshift studies, constraining the epoch of reionization. He is the PI for the HST program CANDELS Lyman-alpha Emission At Reionization (<a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015hst..prop14227P/abstract'>CLEAR</a>). He is a project scientist for <a href="https://instrumentation.tamu.edu/instruments/gmacs/">GMACS</a>, an instrument being designed for the Giant Magellan Telescope. He is also co-investigator on the <a href="https://ceers.github.io/">CEERS</a> Early Release Science program on the <i>James Webb Space Telescope</i>.</p>

												<h3>Jonelle Walsh</h3>
												<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profile_jonelle.jpg" alt="" /></span>Jonelle Walsh studies supermassive black holes in nearby galaxies, using dynamical black hole mass measurements based on observations of stars or gas. Her research focuses on investigating the scaling relations between black holes and properties of their host galaxies, to understand how they grow and co-evolve. She studies black holes in a population of local compact relic galaxies that may provide clues about the scaling relations at higher redshifts. She is also Principal Investigator of a large and Long program on Gemini NIFS to detect and measure black hole masses in galaxies that are poorly-represented in the scaling relations.</p>
