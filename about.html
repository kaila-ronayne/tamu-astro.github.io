                                    <p>The astronomy group has active research programs in the areas of Stellar Populations, Supernovae, Galaxy Evolution, Cosmology, and Astronomical Instrumentation. We use observations from a variety of telescopes to study individual stars in our own Milky Way as well as in nearby galaxies, to track how galaxies assemble over cosmic time, and to understand how the Universe evolves. We also explore the nature of dark matter by testing current theoretical models. Texas A&amp;M is a founding member of the <a href="https://www.gmto.org/">Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT)</a> consortium and is designing and building instruments for current telescopes and the GMT.</p>
									
									<p>Our astronomy graduate students are very passionate about pushing for change, leading the way and working with faculty and staff to make the department a better environment. To learn more about the efforts of our graduate students, and the astronomy group in general, visit our <a href='dei.html'>Diversity &amp; Climate page</a>. Additionally, visit our <a href='codeofconduct.html'>Code of Conduct page</a>.</p>

									<h2>The Program</h2>
									<p>Created in 2006 to be part of the then-called Department of Physics, the astronomy group has quickly gained recognition for its high research output, large success in bringing in grants, majority involvement in department-focused service, and the high caliber scientists that make up its membership. In 2018, the astronomy faculty successfully instated the Astronomy PhD track, therein allowing our graduate students the choice of a Physics PhD (with a focus in Astronomy) or an Astronomy PhD.</p>
									
									<h3>Meet Our People</h3>
									<p>Check out our amazing faculty, postdocs, and graduate students that make up the astronomy group!</p>
									<ul class="actions">
										<li><a href="faculty_list.html" class="button"><font color="#B9A44E">faculty</font></a></li>
										<li><a href="postdoc_list.html" class="button"><font color="#B9A44E">postdocs</font></a></li>
										<li><a href="grad_list.html" class="button"><font color="#B9A44E">grads</font></a></li>
									</ul>

									<h3>The Community</h3>
									<p>We have a small and vibrant community, one which is supported by many activites and by passionate people.  The postdocs, researchers, and graduate students in particular have formed a supportive, inclusive community.  To learn more about this, check out our <a href='community.html'>Community</a> page!</p>

									<p>A recent tradition started among the graduate students is the act of the newly-minted PhDs passing on parting advice and wisdom to their former fellow grads. The wisdom can be anything they want, from encouragement to cautionary tales to life advice. We hope this wisdom can benefit all who read it &mdash; and for any students interested in our program, reading this wisdom can hopefully give you insight into the community that our graduate students hold with each other.</p>

										<h2>Statement Against White Supremacy: <font color="#B9A44E">Black Lives Matter</font></h2>
									</header>
									
									<p>White supremacy pervades our society, systematically and intentionally oppressing Black people. The United States of America is crafted to burden Black people with poverty and neglect their health. Furthermore, it sustains legal slavery via an unjust prison system that disproportionately incarcerates Black people. Additionally, police officers regularly use excessive force and often murder Black people with no legal consequences.</p>

	                <p>We demand justice for Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Daniel Prude, Nina Pop, Rayshard Brooks, David McAtee, Dijon Kizzee, Casey Goodson, and all those who suffer and have suffered at the hands of police brutality and systemic racism. Black lives matter.</br></br></p>

										<h2>Indigenous Land Acknowledgement</h2>
									</header>
									
									<p><strong>The George P. &amp; Cynthia Woods Mitchell Institute for Fundamental Physics and Astronomy</strong>, and all of Texas A&amp;M University, <strong>sits on unceded native land.</strong>
									<!-- Tonkawa -->
									We want to acknowledge the aboriginal and indigenous peoples’ land which we occupy.  This includes the aboriginal homeland of the Tonkawa people -- who in 1855, were forcibly removed by the Texas state government and relocated to northern Oklahoma where they’ve lived ever since.  
									<!-- Bidai -->
									The Brazos County region was also the traditional land of the Atakapa-Ishak people, particularly the Bidai. About half the Bidais were killed in an epidemic in the 1770s, after contact with European colonizers, and the Texas State government forcibly removed the few remaining Bidais in 1854. </p>
